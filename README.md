# GeoServer Web Application

This module contains the GeoServer web application. It is comprised of a backend api on the Java/GeoServer side, and an angular based client. 

## Building

Building it requires Node be [installed](http://nodejs.org/). In addition to 
installing node and npm it is recommended that `bower` and `grunt-cli` be installed 
globally.

    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt-cli

Once the node dependencies are satisifed invoke ant to build the module.

    ant build

This will result in a deployable GeoServer war file.

## Developing

For development it is most convenient to run the backend and front-end 
separately. To run the backend import this module into your Java IDE and run
the `Start` class. By default the backend will start up on port 8080. 

The frontend is run (again only for development) via Grunt. Start by building
the frontend:

    grunt build

Once built start the debug server:

    grunt start

By default the frontend server starts on port 8000. The server will watch for
changes to JavaScript and CSS assets and perform a live reload without having 
to restart the debug server.

### GeoServer Proxy Settings

By default the frontend server will proxy for GeoServer at 
horizon.boundlessgeo.com. To change this create a file named `proxy.json` in the
same directory as `gruntfile.js`. For example:

    {
       "host": "localhost",
       "port": 8080
    }

### Tips and Tricks

Ant build targets:

    Main targets:

     build  Builds project
     help   Print help
     serve  Runs GeoServer
 
Use the following to update client side dependencies:

    npn install
